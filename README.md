# Open Channel Hydraulics
Python modules to use in solving hydraulic elements of an open channel. This uses the Manning's equation in solving the hydraulic elements.

There are three types of open channel classes in this module, _rectangular_, _trapezoidal_ and _circular_.

Here are the checklist for this module:<br/>
- [x] Rectangular
- [x] Trapezoidal
- [x] Circular
- [ ] Irregular

All those unchecked are yet to be written.
