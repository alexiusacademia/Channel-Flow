# Open Channel Hydraulics
Python modules to use in solving hydraulic elements of an open channel. This uses the Manning's equation in solving the hydraulic elements.

There are three types of open channel classes in this module, _rectangular_, _trapezoidal_ and _circular_.

Here are the checklist for this module:<br/>
- [x] Rectangular
- [x] Trapezoidal
- [x] Circular
- [ ] Irregular

All those unchecked are yet to be written.

## Notes:

- In the circular pipe class in the module open channel, I haven't incorporated yet the unit conversion. All units are assumed to be in metric. Although it's easy to incorporate it if you are to use it by subclassing it and override the getter and setter functions.
